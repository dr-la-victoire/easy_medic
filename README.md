# Easy Medic

## A simple tool to aid communication in the hospital

## Background

Easy Medic is a simple tool to aid communication in the workplace. It was inspired during my Industrial Training period, where I served in a public hospital in Nigeria. I observed that the healthcare workers communicated by sending paper forms or written notes, which slowed down operations, and caused delays due to errors on some occassions as it was a bit difficult sometimes to decipher the handwriting.

## Tools

It was built with Flask for functionality. Flask-SQLAlchemy handled the database management. HTML was used for the structure, and Bootstrap was used for the frontend development.

## Installation (users)
