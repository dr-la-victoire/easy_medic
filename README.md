## Background

![Banner with the brand name]()
Easy Medic is a simple tool to aid communication in the workplace. It was inspired during my Industrial Training period, where I served in a public hospital in Nigeria. I observed that the healthcare workers communicated by sending paper forms or written notes, which slowed down operations, and caused delays due to errors on some occassions as it was a bit difficult sometimes to decipher the handwriting.

## Tools

It was built with Flask for functionality. Flask-SQLAlchemy handled the database management. HTML was used for the structure, and Bootstrap was used for the frontend development.

## Installation (developers)

If you want to contribute somehow to this project, here are the steps you must follow;

1. As a prerequisite you must have flask installed with pip or pip3.
   `pip install flask`
2. Initiate a git pull request.
3. Clone this repository to your local machine with the `git clone` command.

You might desire to configure the source code to fit the specific needs of your organisation. You might decide to change the predefined professions and roles, configuring it to meet your organisation-specific needs. It would be nice to inform me before you do so.

Please inform me of any bugs in the program.
